# Requirements

The following requirements have been met in this project.

Topic Selection:

- [x] Either select one of the suggested topics, or come up with your own idea. → We have selected a topic of our own. Our topic was confirmed by the lecturer via email.
- [x] The topic should be possible to easily understand the data context, even if you are not an expert.

Discover:

- [x] Use at least two independent datasets. → We have amonst others used the CSrankings dataset and the public salary disclosure dataset from the University of Waterloo from 4 different years.
- [x] The selected datasets must be multidimensional: they have to contain more than 5 variables. → Each dataset contains 4-5 variables but we extend them by retrieving additional data from the web.
- [x] The selected datasets must contain a sufficient amount of data rows. → The CSrankings dataset contains ~30k rows, the salary disclosure dataset contains ~2k rows.

Prerequisites:

- [x] The lab part has to be solved using a charting library (within a programming language of your choice). Fully-featured applications (e.g., Tableau, PowerBI) are not allowed to be used.

Wrangle:

- [x] Join the two or more datasets you selected into one big data table. → An inner join operation has been performed on the many datasets.
- [x] Solve issues like formatting issues, missing data, faulty values, and non-matching keys. Make the data usable. → The data has been scraped, preprocessed, cleaned and stored in structured file formats.
